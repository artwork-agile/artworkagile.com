## Development with Docker Compose

To build and serve the site locally with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This uses the [`ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.19.1`](https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases/tag/v0.19.1) image to start a live-reloading server available at [http://localhost:1111](http://localhost:1111).
